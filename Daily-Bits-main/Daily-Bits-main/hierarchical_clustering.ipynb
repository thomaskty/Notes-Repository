    "**Agglomerative clustering**: It’s also known as AGNES (Agglomerative Nesting). It works in a bottom-up manner. That is, each object is initially considered as a single-element cluster (leaf). At each step of the algorithm, the two clusters that are the most similar are combined into a new bigger cluster (nodes). This procedure is iterated until all points are member of just one single big cluster (root) (see figure below). The result is a tree which can be plotted as a dendrogram.\n",
