    "**Random Forest**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a type of ensemble learning method, where a group of weak models combine to form a powerful model. The random forest starts with a standard machine learning technique called a “decision tree” which, in ensemble terms, corresponds to our weak learner. In a decision tree, an input is entered at the top and as it traverses down the tree the data gets bucketed into smaller and smaller sets.\n",

    "- Sample N cases at random with replacement to create a subset of the data.\n",
    "- It utilises both bagging and feature randomness to create an uncorrelated forest of decision trees.\n",
    "- Generates a random subset of features, which ensures low correlation among decision trees.\n",
    "- While decision trees consider all the possible feature splits, random forests only select a subset of those features.\n",
    "- The random forest algorithm is made up of a collection of decision trees, and each tree in the ensemble is comprised of a data sample drawn from a training set with replacement, called the bootstrap sample. Of that training sample, one-third of it is set aside as test data, known as the out-of-bag (oob) sample, which we’ll come back to later. Another instance of randomness is then injected through feature bagging, adding more diversity to the dataset and reducing the correlation among decision trees.\n",
    "- Depending on the type of problem, the determination of the prediction will vary. For a regression task, the individual decision trees will be averaged, and for a classification task, a majority vote—i.e. the most frequent categorical variable—will yield the predicted class. Finally, the oob sample is then used for cross-validation, finalising that prediction.\n",

    "**Key Benefits**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduced risk of overfitting: Decision trees run the risk of overfitting as they tend to tightly fit all the samples within training data. However, when there’s a robust number of decision trees in a random forest, the classifier won’t overfit the model since the averaging of uncorrelated trees lowers the overall variance and prediction error.\n",
    "- Provides flexibility: Since random forest can handle both regression and classification tasks with a high degree of accuracy, it is a popular method among data scientists. Feature bagging also makes the random forest classifier an effective tool for estimating missing values as it maintains accuracy when a portion of the data is missing.\n",
    "- Easy to determine feature importance: Random forest makes it easy to evaluate variable importance, or contribution, to the model. There are a few ways to evaluate feature importance. Gini importance and mean decrease in impurity (MDI) are usually used to measure how much the model’s accuracy decreases when a given variable is excluded. However, permutation importance, also known as mean decrease accuracy (MDA), is another importance measure. MDA identifies the average decrease in accuracy by randomly permutating the feature values in oob samples."
