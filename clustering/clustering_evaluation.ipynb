It measures how similar a point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The higher the Silhouette score, the better defined the clusters are.\n","\n","The Silhouette score combines both cohesion (how close points in a cluster are to each other) and separation (how well-separated the clusters are). For each data point, the score compares the average distance to other points within the same cluster (cohesion) to the average distance to points in the nearest cluster (separation). The Silhouette score is calculated for all points in the dataset, and the overall score is the average of individual point scores.\n","\n","The **Silhouette score** for an individual point \\( i \\) is defined as:\n","$$\n","s(i) = \\frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\\max(a(i), b(i))}\n","$$\n","\n","- $ a(i)$ is the **average distance** between point \\( i \\) and all other points in the same cluster. This measures cohesion.\n","- $ b(i) $ is the **minimum average distance** between point \\( i \\) and all points in any other cluster. This measures separation.\n","- $ \\max(a(i), b(i)) $ is used to normalize the score, ensuring that it falls between -1 and 1.\n","\n","- **Cohesion** $a(i)$ measures how well the point \\( i \\) fits within its cluster. A lower value of $a(i)$ means that the point is close to other points in the cluster.\n","- **Separation** $b(i)$ measures how well-separated point $i$ is from the other clusters. A higher value of $b(i)$ means that the point is far from the nearest neighboring cluster.\n","\\\\\n","- The **Silhouette score** $s(i)$ can take values between -1 and 1:\n","  - A score close to **1** indicates that the point is well clustered (both close to its own cluster and far from others).\n","  - A score close to **0** indicates that the point lies on or near the boundary between two clusters.\n","  - A score close to **-1** indicates that the point may have been assigned to the wrong cluster.\n","\n","The **Silhouette score for the entire dataset** is the average of the Silhouette scores of all individual points:\n","\n","- **Assumes Convex Clusters**: The Silhouette score assumes that clusters are convex and isotropic, which may not always be the case, especially for non-globular clusters.\n","- **Sensitive to Outliers**: The score can be sensitive to outliers or noise, as these points can distort the cohesion and separation

A higher CH score generally indicates better clustering.\n","\n","## Key Concept\n","\n","The CH score is based on the dispersion of data points within clusters and between clusters. The goal is to have well-separated clusters (large between-cluster dispersion) and compact clusters (small within-cluster dispersion). The score is calculated as the ratio of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion.\n","\n","### Between-Cluster Dispersion\n","\n","The **between-cluster dispersion matrix** \\( B_k \\) quantifies the spread of the centroids of different clusters. It is calculated by considering the distances between each cluster's centroid and the global centroid (mean of all data points). The more separated the cluster centroids are from the global centroid, the higher the between-cluster dispersion.\n","\n","### Within-Cluster Dispersion\n","\n","The **within-cluster dispersion matrix** \\( W_k \\) measures the compactness of each cluster. It is the sum of squared distances between each data point in a cluster and the cluster's centroid. Smaller within-cluster dispersion indicates that the data points are tightly grouped around their respective centroids.\n","\n","### Calinski-Harabasz Index Equation\n","\n","The Calinski-Harabasz index (CH score) is given by the following formula:\n","\n","\\[\n","CH = \\frac{\\text{tr}(B_k) / (k - 1)}{\\text{tr}(W_k) / (n - k)}\n","\\]\n","\n","Where:\n","- \\( B_k \\) is the **between-cluster dispersion matrix**.\n","- \\( W_k \\) is the **within-cluster dispersion matrix**.\n","- \\( n \\) is the total number of data points.\n","- \\( k \\) is the number of clusters.\n","- \\( \\text{tr}() \\) represents the trace of the matrix (sum of diagonal elements).\n","\n","### Intuition Behind the Formula\n","\n","- The numerator represents the between-cluster dispersion normalized by the number of clusters \\( k \\).\n","- The denominator represents the within-cluster dispersion normalized by the number of data points \\( n \\).\n","- A higher CH score means that the clusters are well-separated (larger between-cluster dispersion) and compact (smaller within-cluster dispersion).\n","\n","## Calculation Steps\n","\n","1. **Compute the Centroids**:\n","   - Calculate the centroid for each cluster. The centroid is the mean of all data points in the cluster.\n","   - Compute the global centroid (mean of all data points in the dataset).\n","\n","2. **Calculate the Within-Cluster Dispersion**:\n","   - For each cluster, calculate the sum of squared distances between each point and the cluster's centroid.\n","   - Sum these values across all clusters to get the total within-cluster dispersion matrix \\( W_k \\).\n","\n","3. **Calculate the Between-Cluster Dispersion**:\n","   - For each cluster, calculate the squared distance between the cluster's centroid and the global centroid.\n","   - Multiply this squared distance by the number of points in the cluster to obtain the total between-cluster dispersion matrix \\( B_k \\).\n","\n","4. **Compute the CH Score**:\n","   - Use the formula mentioned above to compute the CH score by calculating the trace of the dispersion matrices and plugging them into the formula.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Jl2EPtrn1-yN"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n","from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\n","\n","def compute_ch_score(X, labels):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Compute the Calinski-Harabasz (CH) score manually.\n","\n","    Parameters:\n","        X : ndarray, shape (n_samples, n_features)\n","            The data points.\n","        labels : ndarray, shape (n_samples,)\n","            The cluster labels for each data point.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        ch_score : float\n","            The Calinski-Harabasz (CH) score.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # Number of samples and number of clusters\n","    n_samples, n_features = X.shape\n","    k = len(np.unique(labels))\n","\n","    # Compute the overall centroid (mean of all data points)\n","    global_centroid = np.mean(X, axis=0)\n","\n","    # Initialize matrices to calculate within and between cluster dispersion\n","    W_k = np.zeros((n_features, n_features))  # Within-cluster dispersion matrix\n","    B_k = np.zeros((n_features, n_features))  # Between-cluster dispersion matrix\n","\n","    # Iterate through each cluster\n","    for i in range(k):\n","        # Select points in the current cluster\n","        cluster_points = X[labels == i]\n","        cluster_size = len(cluster_points)\n","\n","        # Compute the centroid of the current cluster\n","        cluster_centroid = np.mean(cluster_points, axis=0)\n","\n","        # Within-cluster dispersion: sum of squared distances from points to cluster centroid\n","        W_k += np.dot((cluster_points - cluster_centroid).T, (cluster_points - cluster_centroid))\n","\n","        # Between-cluster dispersion: sum of squared distances from cluster centroid to global centroid\n","        B_k += cluster_size * np.dot((cluster_centroid - global_centroid).T, (cluster_centroid - global_centroid))\n","\n","    # Compute the trace of both dispersion matrices\n","    tr_W_k = np.trace(W_k)\n","    tr_B_k = np.trace(B_k)\n","\n","    # Compute the Calinski-Harabasz Score\n","    ch_score = (tr_B_k / (k - 1)) / (tr_W_k / (n_samples - k))\n","\n","    return ch_score\n","\n","# Create a synthetic dataset with clusters\n","X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=100, centers=3, random_state=42)\n","\n","# Perform KMeans clustering\n","kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)\n","kmeans.fit(X)\n","\n","# Compute the Calinski-Harabasz Score manually\n","ch_score_manual = compute_ch_score(X, kmeans.labels_)\n","\n","print(f\"Manual Calinski-Harabasz Score: {ch_score_manual}\")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"bUJWTgta5XEF","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1734204935416,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":10050,"user":{"displayName":"Thomaskutty Reji","userId":"11414883861734084745"}},"outputId":"756be3d8-3e92-4c2b-ffa5-1153232cba71"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Manual Calinski-Harabasz Score: 3556.176197017689\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"lLUhsU9qqv5r"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
