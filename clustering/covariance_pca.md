# Understanding Cluster Shapes, Covariance Matrices, and Principal Components


## 1. Cluster Shapes: Convex and Isotropic
* A cluster is **convex** if any two points within the cluster can be connected by a straight line that remains entirely inside the cluster. Convexity is geometrically simple and aligns well with algorithms like **K-Means**, which rely on Euclidean distance.
* Clusters are **isotropic** if they spread out uniformly in all directions. This implies:
    * The data has equal variance along all directions.
    * The covariance matrix is proportional to the identity matrix.
* For isotropic clusters, the covariance matrix: $\Sigma = \lambda \mathbf{I}$ where $\lambda$ is a scalar and $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.

* When clusters are non-isotropic:
    * Variance is unequal in different directions.
    * Covariance exists between features.

## 2. Convexity, Covariance Matrix, and Linear Transformations

The **covariance matrix** captures the relationship between features in a dataset. It is symmetric and provides critical information about the spread and orientation of the data.

For a dataset $\mathbf{X}$ with mean $\bar{\mathbf{X}}$:
$$
\Sigma = \frac{1}{n-1} (\mathbf{X} - \bar{\mathbf{X}})^T (\mathbf{X} - \bar{\mathbf{X}})
$$

### As a Linear Transformation
The covariance matrix can be treated as a **linear transformation** that scales and rotates data vectors. For a vector $\mathbf{x}$:
$\mathbf{x'} = \Sigma \mathbf{x}$
This transformation stretches or compresses $\mathbf{x}$ along directions determined by the eigenvectors of $\Sigma$.

##### Example: Covariance Matrix Calculation in Python

```python
import numpy as np
X = np.array([[2, 3], [4, 6], [6, 9]])

mean_X = np.mean(X, axis=0)
centered_X = X - mean_X
cov_matrix = np.cov(centered_X, rowvar=False)
print("Covariance Matrix:", cov_matrix)
```

## 3. Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, and Principal Components

The **eigenvalues** and **eigenvectors** of the covariance matrix provide:

- **Eigenvectors**: Directions of maximum variance (principal directions).
- **Eigenvalues**: Magnitudes of variance along those directions.

- The eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue points in the direction of the greatest spread.
- Smaller eigenvalues correspond to less significant directions.

### Proof: Principal Directions Maximize Variance

The eigenvectors of $\Sigma$ maximize the variance of the projected data. For a unit vector $\mathbf{w}$:
$\text{Variance of projection} = \mathbf{w}^T \Sigma \mathbf{w}$
Maximizing this variance under the constraint $\| \mathbf{w} \| = 1$ leads to the eigenvalue equation:
$\Sigma \mathbf{w} = \lambda \mathbf{w}$

##### Example: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors in Python

```python
# Eigenvalue decomposition
eig_values, eig_vectors = np.linalg.eig(cov_matrix)
print("Eigenvalues:", eig_values)
print("Eigenvectors:", eig_vectors)
```

## 4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that uses eigenvalues and eigenvectors to project data onto its most informative directions.

1. Compute the covariance matrix $\Sigma$.
2. Perform eigenvalue decomposition.
3. Select the top $k$ eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues.
4. Project the data onto these eigenvectors.

##### PCA Example in Python

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Fit PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca.fit(X)

# Transform the data
X_pca = pca.transform(X)
print("PCA Components:", pca.components_)
print("Explained Variance:", pca.explained_variance_)
```

## 5. Transforming Data Using Covariance Matrix

If you multiply data rows by the covariance matrix, the data gets stretched or compressed along the eigenvector directions:
$\mathbf{x'} = \Sigma \mathbf{x}$

- **Stretching**: The data is scaled along the eigenvectors by the eigenvalues.
- **Rotation**: The data aligns with the principal directions.

```python
# Transform data using the covariance matrix
transformed_data = np.dot(X, cov_matrix)
print("Transformed Data:", transformed_data)
```

---

## 6. Numerical Example

$\mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 9 \end{bmatrix}$

#### Covariance Matrix

$\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 9 \end{bmatrix}$

#### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

- Eigenvalues: $\lambda_1 = 13$, $\lambda_2 = 0$
- Eigenvectors: $\mathbf{v}_1 = [0.6, 0.8]$, $\mathbf{v}_2 = [-0.8, 0.6]$

#### Transformation Example

Multiplying $\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$ by $\Sigma$:
$\mathbf{x'} = \begin{bmatrix} 26 \\ 39 \end{bmatrix}$

## 7. Summary

- **Convexity** ensures that clusters are geometrically simple and compatible with algorithms like K-Means.
- **Isotropy** describes uniform spread in all directions, often associated with spherical clusters.
- The **covariance matrix** encodes the relationships between features and determines the shape of data clusters.
- **Eigenvalues and eigenvectors** of the covariance matrix define the principal directions and variances of the data.
- Transforming data with the covariance matrix scales and rotates it along the principal directions.
