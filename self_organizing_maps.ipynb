The weights are typically set to small random values. The SOM consists of a 2D grid of neurons, each of which has a weight vector of the same dimensionality as the input data.\n","\n","Let the weight vector of the $i$-th neuron be $ \\mathbf{w_i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n $, where $n$ is the dimensionality of the input space. Initially, these weight vectors are set randomly.\n","\n","$$\n","\\mathbf{w_i}^{(0)} = \\text{random values}, \\quad i = 1, 2, \\dots, N\n","$$\n","\n","Where $N$ is the total number of neurons in the map.\n","\n","### 2. **Input Selection**\n","\n","At each step in the training process, a random input vector $ \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n $ is selected from the training data.\n","\n","$$\n","\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)\n","$$\n","\n","### 3. **Finding the Best Matching Unit (BMU)**\n","\n","The Best Matching Unit (BMU) is the neuron whose weight vector is most similar to the input vector $ \\mathbf{x} $. This is typically calculated using the Euclidean distance.\n","\n","The BMU, $ \\mathbf{w_{BMU}} $, is found by minimizing the distance between the input vector $ \\mathbf{x} $ and the weight vectors of the neurons in the map:\n","\n","$$\n","BMU = \\arg \\min_{i} \\| \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{w_i} \\|\n","$$\n","\n","Where:\n","- $ \\mathbf{w_i} $ is the weight vector of the $i$-th neuron.\n","- $ \\| \\cdot \\| $ represents the Euclidean distance.\n","\n","### 4. **Updating the Weights**\n","\n","After identifying the BMU, the weights of the BMU and its neighbors are updated to make them more similar to the input vector. This helps the map \"learn\" the input data by adjusting the weights to better represent the data distribution.\n","\n","The weight update rule is as follows:\n","\n","$$\n","\\mathbf{w_i}(t+1) = \\mathbf{w_i}(t) + \\eta(t) \\cdot h_{i, BMU}(t) \\cdot (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{w_i}(t))\n","$$\n","\n","Where:\n","- $ \\mathbf{w_i}(t) $ is the weight vector of the $i$-th neuron at time $t$.\n","- $ \\eta(t) $ is the learning rate at time $t$.\n","- $ h_{i, BMU}(t) $ is the neighborhood function, which determines the influence of the BMU on the other neurons.\n","- $ \\mathbf{x} $ is the input vector.\n","- The neighborhood function $ h_{i, BMU}(t) $ is typically a Gaussian function, defined as:\n","\n","$$\n","h_{i, BMU}(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\| i - BMU \\|^2}{2\\sigma(t)^2}\\right)\n","$$\n","\n","Where:\n","- $ \\sigma(t) $ is the width of the neighborhood at time $t$.\n","- $ \\| i - BMU \\| $ is the distance between the $i$-th neuron and the BMU on the grid.\n","\n","### 5. **Decay of Learning Rate and Neighborhood Size**\n","\n","As training progresses, the learning rate $ \\eta(t) $ and the neighborhood size $ \\sigma(t) $ are decayed over time to ensure that the map converges. The decay functions typically take the following forms:\n","\n","$$\n","\\eta(t) = \\eta_0 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_1}\\right)\n","$$\n","$$\n","\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_2}\\right)\n","$$\n","\n","Where:\n","- $ \\eta_0 $ is the initial learning rate.\n","- $ \\sigma_0 $ is the initial neighborhood size.\n","- $ \\tau_1 $ and $ \\tau_2 $ are time constants that control the decay rates.\n","\n","### 6. **Iteration and Convergence**\n","\n","The above steps are repeated for a number of iterations or until the map has converged. During each iteration, the weights of the neurons are updated to better represent the data. Over time, the neurons self-organize, with similar input vectors being mapped to nearby neurons.\n","\n","### 7. **Final Map**\n","\n","After the training process is complete, the SOM will have organized the neurons in such a way that similar data points are represented by nearby neurons on the map. The map can now be used for visualization, clustering, or other tasks.\n","\n","## Summary of Equations\n","\n","1. **Initialization**: Random weight vectors $ \\mathbf{w_i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n $.\n","2. **BMU Identification**:\n","   $$\n","   BMU = \\arg \\min_{i} \\| \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{w_i} \\|\n","   $$\n","3. **Weight Update**:\n","   $$\n","   \\mathbf{w_i}(t+1) = \\mathbf{w_i}(t) + \\eta(t) \\cdot h_{i, BMU}(t) \\cdot (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{w_i}(t))\n","   $$\n","4. **Neighborhood Function**:\n","   $$\n","   h_{i, BMU}(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\| i - BMU \\|^2}{2\\sigma(t)^2}\\right)\n","   $$\n","5. **Decay Functions**:\n","   $$\n","   \\eta(t) = \\eta_0 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_1}\\right)\n","   $$\n","   $$\n","   \\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_2}\\right)\n","   $$\n","\n","## Conclusion\n","\n","Self-Organizing Maps are powerful tools for clustering and visualizing high-dimensional data.
